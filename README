                     *Minimal* set-up for exploratory work
                        with a local Apache HTTP Server

Disclaimer ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't know what to call the *Apache* HTTP Server, 'cause we call it that,
    but we also call the Apache Software Foundation that.  In many cases, I'll
    use "httpd" to mean the Apache HTTP Server.  Further justification is deemed
    unnecessary but may be purveyed at your demand.

Minimal? -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure.  Most of the code's just the built-in httpd.conf from either version
    of httpd, with hundreds of ineffective lines removed.  It's kept intact only
    to be sure to replicate the absolute default configuration you'd start with
    in any and all cases.

        .
        ├── Dockerfile-2.2
        ├── Dockerfile-2.4
        ├── httpd-2.2.conf
        ├── httpd-2.4.conf
        ├── httpd.conf
        ├── httpd-ssl.conf
        ├── README
        └── start.sh

Usage --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just edit the Dockerfile-<version> and corresponding httpd-<version>.conf,
    then run:

        ./start.sh [version] ............. version ∈ { "2.2", "2.4", undefined }

    If you don't specify a version, it'll default to 2.4.

    It'll create a fresh self-signed certificate for you and set it up for use
    within Apache.  Then, it'll start an Apache HTTP server instance, with the
    version of your choosing.

    n.b.: you may refer to your host machine as "host" from within the
    container.  For illustration, the following directive would proxy requests
    to a Web server linting on the port 8080 of your host machine:

        ProxyPass  /  http://host:8080/
                             ^^^^

    You may add more files and copy them at build time in the corresponding
    Dockerfile or mount them from start.sh.  You may need to include them from
    httpd-<version>.conf.  If possible, try to keep your changes towards the
    very end of that file, where we concentrate the deviations from the base
    one, after the large banner explaining as such in clear terms.
